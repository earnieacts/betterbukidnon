# Architecture

BetterBukidnon is a **static website**: hand-written HTML pages, one shared stylesheet set,
vanilla JavaScript, and JSON data files fetched in the browser. There is no server-side code
and no database. One page (`/services/health`) is built with Next.js and merged in at build
time. Cloudflare Workers serves the built files as static assets.

## Pages

Every page is a complete HTML document, so it works without JavaScript, without a build step
and without layout shift. The page chrome is copied into each page, but it is generated from
one source (see [Shared page chrome](#shared-page-chrome)):

1. Hotline bar (emergency numbers)
2. Header with logo, navigation and the EN / FIL / CEB language buttons
3. Real-time info bar (exchange rate, Malaybalay weather, Philippine time)
4. Page content (`<main id="main-content">`)
5. Footer (tagline, links, resources, "Cost to the People of Bukidnon = ₱0", partners, version)
6. Volunteer popup markup (homepage)

The skip link, hotline bar, header and footer are shared. The real-time info bar, page
content and volunteer popup belong to each page. The hotline numbers live in
[bukidnon-facts.md](bukidnon-facts.md); keep them in sync.

### Shared page chrome

| Block       | Template                        | Contains                                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `skip-link` | `scripts/chrome/skip-link.html` | "Skip to main content" link                                 |
| `hotline`   | `scripts/chrome/hotline.html`   | Emergency hotline bar                                       |
| `header`    | `scripts/chrome/header.html`    | Logo, navigation with dropdowns, EN / FIL / CEB buttons     |
| `footer`    | `scripts/chrome/footer.html`    | Tagline, links, resources, "Cost to the People" and version |

To change any of these, edit the template once and run:

```bash
npm run chrome          # rewrite the block in every page
npm run chrome:check    # fail if a page differs from the templates (also run by build.sh and the tests)
```

In a page, each block sits between two marker comments. Never edit between them by hand; the
next `npm run chrome` overwrites it.

```html
<!-- chrome:header -->
...generated...
<!-- /chrome:header -->
```

`scripts/sync-chrome.js` fills in what differs from page to page:

- `{{root}}` is the path to the site root (`''`, `../`, or `/` on `403.html`, `404.html` and
  `500.html`, which are served from any URL). `{{home}}` is the link to the homepage.
- `{{active:key}}` marks the nav item for the page's section (`services` and
  `service-details` highlight Services, `budget` highlights Transparency, and so on). The
  mapping is `SECTION_NAV` and `PAGE_NAV` in the script.
- `{{version}}` comes from `version.json`, so a version bump and the footer stay in step.
- Options go after the block name in the marker: `<!-- chrome:footer no-margin-top -->`
  (used on `services/index.html` and a few `service-details/` pages).
- The script formats the result with Prettier, so the generated pages pass `format:check`.

A new page needs the four marker pairs (copy them from any page, for example `faq/index.html`)
and then `npm run chrome`. A page without them fails `chrome:check`, except `offline.html`,
which is standalone on purpose.

All of the chrome uses one set of translation keys: `nav-*` for the skip link and navigation,
`footer-*` for the footer. Do not add per-page prefixes to them.

Links use clean URLs (`/services/health`, `/service-details/pswdo`). Cloudflare's
`html_handling: auto-trailing-slash` maps them to the `.html` files, and `serve.py` does the
same locally.

## JavaScript

All scripts are plain browser JavaScript loaded with `defer`. No bundler.

Pages must keep working when a data file is empty: they show an empty state that links to
the official source. See [content-guide.md](content-guide.md) for how to fill them.

## React app (`react-app/`)

A Next.js 14 + TypeScript app with its own header, footer, hotline bar and language context
(`src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx`). It is exported statically (`react-app/out/`). The build
copies only `out/_next/` and `out/services/health.html` into `dist/`, so in production
`/services/health` is the React page and everything else is the static site. The React app is
**not** generated from `scripts/chrome/`: when you change shared chrome (nav items, hotlines,
footer links, languages), change `Header.tsx`, `HotlineBar.tsx`, `Footer.tsx` and
`LanguageContext.tsx` by hand as well.
`npm run chrome:check` compares the links in `scripts/chrome/header.html` with the ones in
`Header.tsx` and fails if either has a link the other lacks. It does not compare labels or
translations.
`npm run chrome:check` compares the links in `scripts/chrome/header.html` with the ones in
`Header.tsx` and fails if either has a link the other lacks. It does not compare labels or
translations.

## Build pipeline

`build.sh` (run by `npm run build`):

0. Loads `.env` if present (`SITE_URL`, see `.env.example`)
1. Bumps the version (`scripts/bump-version.js` updates `version.json`, `package.json`, the
   version shown in every page footer and `react-app/public/version.json`), then runs
   `scripts/sync-chrome.js --check` and stops if a page differs from the chrome templates
2. Cleans `dist/`
3. Copies the site into `dist/` with `rsync` (or `scripts/copy-dist.js` on Windows), leaving
   out `docs/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`, `admin/`, `react-app/`, `node_modules/`, Markdown files
   and config files
4. Builds the React app and merges `/services/health`
5. Minifies HTML (html-minifier-terser), CSS (clean-css) and JS (Babel + Terser)
6. Sets file permissions (a cPanel leftover; harmless on Cloudflare)

## Progressive Web App

`manifest.webmanifest` makes the site installable. `sw.js` precaches the core pages and
assets and serves `offline.html` when the network is down. When you add, rename or delete a
page that is in the precache list, update `PRECACHE_URLS` and bump `CACHE_VERSION` in `sw.js`
so browsers drop the old cache.
